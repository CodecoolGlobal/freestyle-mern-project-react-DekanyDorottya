                Butterball was found as a stray in Louisiana, severely
                emaciated, with every inch of her tiny body covered in thick
                clumps of fleas. At 4 months old, she was just skin and bones,
                weighing a measly 5lbs. Thankfully, she was a resilient little
                girl who took to treatment quickly and was making incredible
                progress in just a few weeks time. She put on some weight and it
                wasn’t long before she was acting like a puppy again! It wasn’t
                long before this sweet girl charmed her way into the heart of
                one of Animal Haven’s volunteers and the rest was history!
