                Your sponsorship directly helps your cosen sponsor dog, and all
                the dogs in our care too. Your sponsorship money is used to
                cover the costs of running the rehoming centre, ensuring things
                like heating the kennels and washing the beds can tick along
                nicely. Your sponsorship also goes towards tasty treats, fun
                enrichment toys, vital training and any medical care a dog may
                need â€“ all with the ultimate goal of finding each dog their
                loving forever home.
